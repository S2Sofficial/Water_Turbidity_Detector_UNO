# Water Quality Monitoring using Turbidity Sensor & Arduino UNO
Water quality monitoring is crucial for ensuring safe and clean water in various applications such as drinking water, aquaculture, and industrial processes. One key parameter for assessing water quality is turbidity, which measures the cloudiness or haziness of water caused by suspended particles. High turbidity can indicate the presence of pollutants and harmful microorganisms.

In this project, we use an Arduino UNO and a turbidity sensor to monitor water quality. The turbidity sensor measures the turbidity level of the water and sends the data to the Arduino. The Arduino processes this data and displays the turbidity level on an LCD screen. Additionally, the data can be transmitted to a virtual terminal for logging and analysis.

## Introduction:

## Turbidity Sensor Working Principle:
When light passes through a certain amount of water, the amount of light penetration depends on the amount of dirt in the water. As the amount of dirt increases, the light that penetrates the water sample decreases, and the turbidity sensor measures the amount of light transmitted to calculate the turbidity of the wash water. Inside the sensor is an infrared pair tube. When light passes through a certain amount of water, the amount of light transmitted depends on the degree of contamination of the water. The dirtier the water, the less light is transmitted.

The turbidity unit is measured in NTU “Nephelometric Turbidity Units” which is global standard. The larger the turbidity is, the cloudy of the sample is. Turbidity sensor connects to the microcontroller through an analog to digital converter through this A to D converter.
